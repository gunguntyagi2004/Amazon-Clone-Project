# Amazon-Clone-Project
This project is a clone of the Amazon website built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the look and feel of Amazon's homepage and product listing pages. The focus of this project was to practice front-end development skills, particularly using CSS for layout, styling, and responsiveness. While it doesn't have the functionality of a full e-commerce site, it showcases the design and structure of a modern web application.

Features
Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
Styled navigation bar, product cards, and footer
Consistent design elements similar to the Amazon website
Feel free to explore the code and see how the structure and styling were achieved!
